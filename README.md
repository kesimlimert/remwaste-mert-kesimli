# REMWaste Challenge

While I was redesigning, I preferred a minimal approach. Also, I picked a softer color palette for the theme. I used lighter blue accent colors to get a softer look. After I examined the original design, the main things for selecting a skip are skip size, price, and hire period. Therefore, I decided to display those three options only at first look. If the user selects a skip card, the card item collapses to show the image. This feature lets the user focus on price, skip size, and hire period. Added filter functionality to find the correct skip option easily.
