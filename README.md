# REMWaste Challenge

While I was redesigning, I preferred minimal approach. Also picked softer color palette for theme. I used lighther blue accent colors to get softer looking. After I examined original design, main thing for selecting skip are skip size, price and hire period. Therefore I decided to display that three option only on first look. If user select a skip card, card item collapses to show image. This feature lets user focus to price, skip size and hire period. Added filter functionality to find correct skip option easily.
